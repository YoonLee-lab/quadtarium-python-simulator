''' name: Spline Interpolation Demo
    author: Christopher Banks
    date: 10/14/18
    description: A simple go-to-spline example. Quadcopters are controlled by allowing users to specify points to the 
    quadcopters in the form of a numpy array. A spline interpolation program finds splines that satisfy the constraints
    of the quadcopter and generates an n-differentiable function. Users can use the spline interpolation function to generate
    splines from a sequence of waypoints and send these points to the Robotarium.'''

    # iterate until time limit is reached, the max time our quadcopters can run is 5 minutes so experiments will be
    # limited to that time
